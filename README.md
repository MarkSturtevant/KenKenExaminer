# KenKenExaminer
A very simple JavaFX program that collects data about a KenKen Puzzle.

The user inputs the puzzle through the GUI, and the program outputs data such as the number of possible ways to fill each cage in the puzzle, number of cages of specific sizes, and other data.

The purpose of this program is to generate data that will be used to develop the difficulty measure of a KenKen puzzle in another game.  The data itself comes from a KenKen book of differently sized KenKen puzzles of various difficulty.
